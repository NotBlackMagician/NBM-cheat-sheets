Most used commands:


case-sensitive search

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Filter "*whatYouNeed*" |   
Where-Object { $_.Name -clike "*whatYouNeed*" } |   
Select { $_.FullName } |
Table -Wrap -AutoSize |
Out-File ~\Documents\command_output.txt


search by file's content

Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse | 
Select-String -Pattern 'what you remember' -AllMatch -Context 2 |
Table -Wrap -AutoSize |
Out-File ~\Documents\command_output.txt



EXPLANATIONS AND MOST POPULAR PARAMETERS:

GET-CHILDITEM
Get-ChildItem - ( aliases: dir, ls, gci ), lists content of folder/directory just like Linux ls command
-Path - tells where the command should be looking for files to show us ( ~\ will look for files inside you user's directory, ~\Documents\ will look for them inside Documents folder)
-Recurse - tells the gci command to be recurring, which means that the operation will be repeated inside every folder of the path that we specified
-Filter - filters the output of the command to only show what matches the filter. For example -Filter "*.txt" will look only for .txt files
-Depth - specifies how deep you want the gci to look for a file/folder. Often combined with -Recurse. For example -Recurse -Depth 1 tells the gci to look inside the current folder and inside every folder of the current folder
-File - look only for files
-Directory - look only for folders
-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue - don't display error messages and continue working
-Force - show files usually not accessible to the user (system files, hidden files)
-Hidden - show ONLY files usually not accessible to the user (system files, hidden files)


WHERE-OBJECT
Where-Object - ( aliases: ?, where ) used as a filter when you have many results
Where-Object { $_.Name -clike "*Item*" } - look for a name that has exactly the same letters
Where-Object { $_.FullName -notlike "*more*" } - look for a file/folder, but in paths NOT containing "more" as a directory or as a part of filename
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*green*" -File | Where-Object { $_.FullName -match "\\More items\\" } - looks for a file with "green" in its name that at some point is inside of "more items" folder (use -cmatch to look only inside "More items" folder)

EXAMPLE:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*item*" | 
Where-Object { $_.name -clike"*green*" }


SELECT-OBJECT
Select-Object - ( aliases: Select ) selects which parameters of results to show, used as another filter
Select-Object { $_.FullName } - shows only filenames with paths
Select-Object -Property * - shows all properties
Select-Object -Property Path - shows only the path of an object

EXAMPLE:
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -File | 
Select-String -Pattern 'match' -List | 
Select -Property Path


SELECT-STRING
Select-String - ( aliases: sls ) selects text within a file (even inside picture files, like .svg files)
Select-String -Pattern 'match' - looks for a pattern specified ( "match" in our case )
Select-String -List - shows only first pattern found in eachfile searched. Great for listing files
Select-String -AllMatch - shows every pattern found inside every file searched
Select-String -Context 2 - shows content of specified amount of lines before and after the found match
Select-String -Raw - doesn't show the path to the file, only its content. Great for scripting and automation. Often used with -Context option

EXAMPLE:
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Filter "*.txt" -Recurse | 
Select-String -Pattern 'match' -List | 
Select -Property Path


OUT-FILE
Out-File - ( aliases: > ) creates a file or puts the content into the file specified
-Append - doesn't erase the content of the file, but puts everything at the end of the specified file, like Out-File -Append ~\Documents\command_output.txt

Get-ChildItem -Filter "*.txt" -Recurse | 
Select-String -Pattern 'match' -List | 
Select -Property Path | 
Out-File ~\Documents\command_output.txt


FORMAT-TABLE
Format-Table - usually used for making the view of parameters clearer, but can also be a filter or a bug fix, like in our case
Format-Table -Wrap -AutoSize - allows for any output of command to be shown, no matter how long.

EXAMPLES:
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Filter "*.txt" -Recurse | 
Select-String -Pattern 'match' -List | 
Select -Property Path | 
Format-Table -Wrap -AutoSize |
Out-File ~\Documents\command_output.txt
